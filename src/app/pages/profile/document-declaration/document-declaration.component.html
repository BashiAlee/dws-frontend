          contained in a file that is uploaded; or (viii) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the
          forum. We reserve the right to terminate your access to any or all of the forums or data base at any time

          officers, directors, owners, agents, information providers, affiliates and licensors (collectively, the
          "Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, claims, causes of actions, costs and
          expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by any Party in connection with any claim arising
          out of (1) any use or alleged use of your account or password by any person, whether or not authorized by you,
          (2) any claim arising out of the material, documentation and information that you submit to Drone Workforce
          Solutions, LLC, including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, violation of rights of publicity and/or
          privacy, copyright infringement, trademark infringement and any claim or liability relating to the content,
          quality, or performance of materials, documentation and information that you submit to Drone Workforce
          Solutions, LLC on the data base. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
          control of any matter or provide our own attorney or law firm to assist you otherwise subject to indemnification
          by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense or assistance of such claim. The listing, or
          absence of listing, of any material, documentation or information in the database does not imply any warranty or
          guarantee by us, for any companies, products, hiring, drone jobs or services described in such materials,
          documentation or information. We disclaim any and all responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content,
          completeness, legality, reliability, or operability or availability of materials, documentation or information
          displayed in the data base search results. We disclaim any responsibility for the deletion, failure to store,
          mis-delivery, or untimely delivery of any material, documentation or information. We disclaim any responsibility
          for any harm resulting from downloading or accessing any information or material on the World Wide Web or
          Internet using search results from the data base. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE DATA BASE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
          ERROR-FREE. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE DATA BASE
          OR SERVICE OR THE CONTENT. THE DATA BASE, SERVICE AND THE CONTENT ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS, AS AVAILABLE"
          BASIS. ANY MATERIAL, DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE DATA BASE OR
          SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGES TO
          YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL, DOCUMENTATION OR
          INFORMATION. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
          LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
          WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA BASE OR SERVICE, ANY CONTENT OR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD THROUGH THE DATA BASE OR
          SERVICE. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE DATA
          BASE AND SERVICE AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ITS CONTENT. WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,
          INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE DATA
          BASE OR SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO
          TERMINATE THE DATA BASE OR SERVICE AND YOUR RIGHT TO USE SUCH AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. Any controversy or
          claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions or our data base or sites will be settled by
          binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.
          Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any
          arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in Wilmington,
          Delaware, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Either
          you or we may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Wilmington,
          Delaware necessary to protect the rights or property of you or the Party (or its agents, suppliers, and
          subcontractors) pending the completion of arbitration. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire
          agreement between you and the Parties with respect to the Service, and supersedes all previous or
          contemporaneous written or oral agreements. If any part of these Terms and Conditions is determined to be
          invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
          superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and
          the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall continue in effect. Some states do not allow exclusion of
          implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations
          or exclusions may not apply to you. In such states, our liability and that of our third party content providers
          and their respective agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

          arising
          out of or relating to these Terms or our data base will be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the
          commercial
          arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on
          an
          individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other

          The arbitration shall be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered

          so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. In such states, our liability and that of our third
          party
          content providers and their respective agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
